# Carbon_stock_with_allometric_biomass_models
This repository contains pre-processing of a database belonging to the network of permanent forest sampling plots in natural coniferous forests registered by the National Institute of Forests (INAB) in Guatemala. This is part of a project to estimate carbon stock in tropical forests using generic allometric biomass models.
